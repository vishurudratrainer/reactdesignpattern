Custom hook pattern gives great control, but makes also your component harder to integrate because the user has to deal with a lot of native hookâ€™s props and recreate the logic on his side. The Props Getters Pattern pattern attempts to mask this complexity. Instead of exposing native props, we provide a shortlist of props getters. A getter is a function that returns many props, it has a meaningful name allowing the user to naturally link it to the right JSX element.
